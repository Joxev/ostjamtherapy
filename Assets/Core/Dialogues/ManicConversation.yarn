... I'm sorry, what were you saying?
<< SetSpeaker Otis Neutral>>
I wasn't saying anything, doctor.
<< SetSpeaker Alwin Neutral>>
Oh, yes. My mistake. Do you go by "Otis?"
<< SetSpeaker Otis Neutral>>
"Otis" or "Odie." Well, that's more what my parents call me, I suppose.
<< SetSpeaker Alwin Neutral>>
"Odie," hm? I like that. Are you close with your parents?
<< SetSpeaker Otis Neutral>>
Closer than most, heh. I live with them.
<< SetSpeaker Alwin Neutral>>
Ah. How's that going?
<< SetSpeaker Otis Neutral>>
It's usually alright. But lately things have been weird. That's why they said I should come here. 'Dunno why. I feel fine.
<< SetSpeaker Alwin Neutral>>
Well, let's see if we can get to the bottom of this.

I guess it means they don't want to talk to me themselves, huh?
<< SetSpeaker Alwin Neutral>>
-> Do you not get along with them?
    [[ Otis.QuestionOneAdviceOne]]
-> Do you wish you got along with them better?
    << SetSpeaker Otis Neutral>>
    I mean, yeah. Of course.

It's not that we don't get along. But I guess we don't talk as much as we used to.
<< SetSpeaker Alwin Neutral>>
-> You should open up to your family.
    << ChangeEmotionValues Sadness 40>>
-> You have got to watch your temper.
